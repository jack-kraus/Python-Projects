# Poetry and Songwriting Tool
A simple tool that takes in two words, asks you to specify the defintion(s) you want to search for,
and returns the collection of words that are synonyms of those words and rhyme with each other.
The tool uses beautiful soup to web scrape from [thesaursus.com](https://www.thesaurus.com) and [rhymezone.com](https://www.rhymezone.com)

## Setup
Run the following command in the directory to install necessary packages:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


Then simply run the `run.py` file
`py run.py` for windows or `python3 run.py` for Max and Linux
